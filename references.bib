@TechReport{EPFL-REPORT-176887,
   abstract    = {Programming interactive systems by means of the observer
                 pattern is hard and error-prone yet is still the
                 implementation standard in many production environments.
                 We show how to integrate different reactive programming
                 abstractions into a single framework that help migrate
                 from observer-based event handling logic to more
                 declarative implementations. Our central API layer embeds
                 an extensible higher-order data-flow DSL into our host
                 language. This embedding is enabled by a continuation
                 passing style transformation.},
